This relates to disciplines required for the public admission exam to work at Banco do Brasil, in the IT Department, including, but not limited to:

- Statistics
- Banking Practices
- Financial and Pure Mathematics
- Foundations of Capital Markets
- Basic and Advanced Economics
- Current Topics of Information Technology, such as:
    -- Artifical Inteligence (Machine Learning)
    -- Basic Programming in different languages
- Portuguese and English languages

I don't really know why this is public. I guess it's to keep up with Best Practices in Git.

Enjoy :)
